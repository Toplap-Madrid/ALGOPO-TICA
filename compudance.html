The qiudanz technique is a movement practice based on the computational transformation of movement sequences. Its purpose is to create and share dances based on abstract computational machines. The technique is part of a commitment to playfully disseminate and preserve computer science beyond electronic devices and industrial civilization.

The workshop consists of a guided movement and play session in which we will (re)connect with our bodies and re-appropriate computational concepts for the sake of creating nerdy dances and having a fun time. In the workshop, we will introduce and explore the minimalist movement vocabulary of the technique, learn how these movements are combined into sequences, and practice queue-based computational operations to transform these sequences while dancing them. We will engage in several one-to-many and one-to-one activities and games based on the technique. The experience will combine cognitive abilities such as memory and logic thinking with movement coordination and somatic expression.

To participate in the workshop, we welcome people concerned about the environmental and social impacts of digital technologies, as well as people curious about embodying computational thinking. Previous experience with movement practices or computational thinking is not needed. All the activities are designed to be adapted to different ranges of mobility. The workshop engages with human-scale computing and provides a possible answer to the question: what would happen if computers were dances instead of closed electronic devices?    </div>
